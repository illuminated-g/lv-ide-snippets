To use the custom VI for Override scripting, copy the VI to the OverrideRetooler folder, typically found as below.

C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW ####\resource\Framework\Providers\LVClassLibrary\NewAccessors\OverrideRetooler

You will then need to restart LabVIEW after updating the VI for it to begin working.
